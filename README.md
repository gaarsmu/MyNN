# MyNN - simple neural network package
This is simple neural network package build from raw numpy, so it is as simple as can be. I implemented some RL algorithms with it, like DQN, 
REINFORCE, Actor-Critic, TRPO and PPO etc. Examples with those algorithms solving classical OpenAI Gym environments 
could be found in jupyter notebooks with correspondent names.
